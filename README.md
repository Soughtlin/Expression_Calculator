# Expression_Calculator
This is a calculator for real number expression operations. I made a brief UI for this calculator using qmake and C++

This has also been the first project with UI that I perform since I learned Qt. At first, I was trying to make it by using CMake so that I can connect it with Clion and learn something about GREAT Cmake(which I have been thinking about for a long time), but I failed because there is something wrong with my setting and the CMake project can not be configured. Considering the time consuming, I finally choosed to use qmake.

The project is nothing special and really poor. I even haven't completed the function for dicimals and power operation. Just really really basic functions.

The plan for future:
1.Trying to build the project by using CMake and Clion(get rid of rubbish Qt creator), and learn CMake when using.
2.complete this calculator
3.make a UI for the last project(polynomials calculator)
